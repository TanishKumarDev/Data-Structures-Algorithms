# ðŸš€ Problem Solving Journey

This repository contains my structured approach to mastering Data Structures, Algorithms, and Competitive Programming using C++. It includes well-organized folders for concepts, topics, and contests.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `ðŸ§© DSA Problems` â€“ Contains categorized problems with clear filenames:
  - `1.2 Pattern Printing`
  - `1.3 STL`
  - `1.4 Basic Maths`
  - `1.5 Recursion`
  - `Arrays`
  - `Segment Tree`
  
- `Contests` â€“ Problems solved during Codeforces, Leetcode, and other competitive contests.

## ðŸ›  Languages & Tools

- C++ (with STL)
- Leetcode, Codeforces, GFG

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights

- Focused on clean code and clear naming.
- Real contest problems with my accepted solutions.
- Beginner to advanced level practice.
