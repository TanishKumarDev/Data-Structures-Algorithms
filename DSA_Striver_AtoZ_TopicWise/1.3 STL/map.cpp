// time complexity: O(log n) for insertion, deletion, and access
// space complexity: O(n) for storing n elements
// Note: map is ordered by keys, while unordered_map is not. Use unordered_map for faster access if order doesn't matter.
// Also, map stores keys in sorted order, while unordered_map does not guarantee any order.
// This is a simple demonstration of how to use the map data structure in C++.
// The map is a part of the C++ STL (Standard Template Library) and is used to store key-value pairs.
// It is implemented as a balanced binary search tree (usually a Red-Black tree), which allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
// The map is a very useful data structure for many applications, such as counting frequencies, storing configurations, and more.
// The map is a very versatile data structure and is widely used in competitive programming and software development.
// It is important to understand how to use it effectively and efficiently.
// The map is a powerful tool that can help you solve many problems in programming.
